<h2>Summary of the Project </h2>
<p class="text-muted">In a paragraph mention the main idea behind your project. Focus on the problem setup, not the solution, i.e. what is your goal? At the very least, you should have a sentence that clearly explains the input/output semantics of your project, i.e. what information will it take as input, and what will it produce. Mention any applications, if any, for your project.</p>
<p class="mt-2">Our general idea/ultimate goal is to have our agent run around the maze and pick up as many rewards (such as diamond) before exiting the maze. The agent initially does not have any knowledge about the maze; it does not know where the diamonds and obstacles (like zombies) are located. Instead, the agent will explore the maze to figure out where things are and remember them for the next iteration. The AI program terminates when the agent exits the maze or the maximum step allowed is exceeded. At termination, the agent will report its total rewards, which are calculated based on how many diamonds it picked up and how many moves the agent made.</p>

<h2>Evaluation Plan</h2>
<!-- Delete the instruction once completed-->
<p class="text-muted">Mention how you will evaluate the success of your project. In a paragraph, focus on the quantitative evaluation: what are the metrics, what are the baselines, by how much you expect your approach to improve the metric, what data will you evaluate on, etc. In another paragraph, describe what qualitative analysis you will show to verify the project works, such as what are the sanity cases for the approach, how will you visualize the internals of the algorithm to verify it works, what’s your moonshot case, i.e. it’ll be awesome and impressive if you get there. Note that these are not promises, we’re not going to hold you to what you say here, but we want to see if you are able to think about evaluation of your project in a critical manner.</p>
<p class="mt-2">The agent will be evaluated on total rewards. The number of diamonds picked up by the agent will be the major factor in total rewards. In addition, we will have two different rewards for the agent: a diamond block and a diamond ore; a diamond block is worth 10 times as much as a diamond ore. Hence, it will be significant to set how many rewards the agent can pick up and how “efficiently” the agent can do so. Each move the agent makes will decrease the total score by -1, which means that the agent is expected to make better moves to achieve a higher score. The agent will be made smarter by not making unnecessary moves, and this quality will be enforced by a negative consequence to total rewards for each agent's move. This way, the agent will not only find a way to pick up as many diamonds, but also make the best moves to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>At Minimum Goal stage, the agent will peacefully pick up diamonds with no enemies, so the total elapsed time should be minimum and total rewards should be maximum with little to no unnecessary moves, and after some runs, the agents should be consistent in these metrics as the diamonds have fixed positions. At Realistic Goal, the agent will now pick up diamonds while evading the enemies. First goal is to maximize the agent’s score by picking up as many diamonds as possible in an efficient way before the iteration ends. Next, the agent will take optimized path to pick up more diamonds on the way of avoiding the enemies. Here, we don’t have any method to get rid of the zombies yet, so the agent would have to find a different way if the best possible path is blocked by the zombies. For Ambitious Goal, we would like to add weapon to a few locations of the maze and let agent subdue the enemy for short period time using the weapon. So the agent will not simply run away from enemies, but it will sometimes make better choice to pick up the weapon and charge toward enemies if it maximizes total rewards.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<!-- Delete the instruction once completed-->
<p class="text-muted">Next pick 3 goals. The first goal is the minimum goal. This is the minimum your project should achieve to pass the course. The second goal is the realistic goal, this is a goal you will likely achieve during the course and should provide some interesting results. The third goal is the ambitious one, this would provide you awesome results but would be difficult to achieve. For reference think of how goals are described in crowdfunding projects like Kickstarter.</p>
